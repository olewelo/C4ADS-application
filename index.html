                    <h2>Cornelis Vrolijk, one of the biggest fishing companies in Europe, has a strong presence on the African continent. 
                        While it presents itself as the provider of quality food for the continent, its fish-catching methods in African waters 
                        have repeatedly been hit by scandals. Our investigation found that one of the biggest scandals that happened is not isolated,

                            Captain Kazi was one of the oldest and most experienced captains in the Atlantic Shrimpers fleet. For over 30 years, he worked for the Namibian company that prides itself as the largest fishing company in West Africa. Kazi, says his colleague Rasheed Kosoko, helped build that company.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            But then Kazi gets arrested. With the support of Sea Shepherd, in March 2017, Liberian authorities boarded his ship and took the crew into custody. The charge: fishing illegally in Liberian waters, the most serious offense under Liberian fishery law. 
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            The case received attention, not only in Liberia but also in Europe. The reason: Atlantic Shrimpers, the company Kazi sailed for, is <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2018/629176/IPOL_STU(2018)629176_EN.pdf"><span class="single-line">owned by</span> Dutch fishing giant <span class="single-line">Cornelis Vrolijk.</span></a>
                            In an <a href="https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/nederlandse-visgigant-weer-gepakt-voor-illegaal-vissen-in-afrika">interview</a> with the Dutch publication Follow the Money, the Vrolijk manager responsible for Atlantic Shrimpers blames the captain of the vessel and says his actions go completely against company policy. He threatens disciplinary action, saying "we really don't want these kinds of nasty problems." Indeed, the company later announced it had fired Captain Kazi and his Chief Engineer.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Kazi, in his sixties, decides to not look for a new job. He retires and moves back to his family in Ghana. This marks the end of an over 30-year-long career as a fisherman, a career without any disciplinary incidences -- up until the end. 
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            What the Vrolijk manager portrays as an isolated incident caused by a rogue individual, however, is not isolated. It is common practice. Our investigation came across a large number of incidences involving Cornelis Vrolijk and its subsidiaries, painting a very different picture of the family-owned company.

                        <h1>
                            Cornelis Vrolijk
                        </h1>
                        <p1>
                            Cornelis Vrolijk is amongst the biggest fishing companies in Europe. The Ijmuiden-based conglomerate has a yearly revenue exceeding EUR 500 million and a fleet of close to a hundred vessels worldwide. Much of their visible activity is in Europe, especially in the Channel and around the British Isles. Only very little is known about Vrolijk's activities in Africa. 
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Yet, of the three big Dutch fishing companies, Cornelis Vrolijk is likely the one with the biggest foothold on the continent, says journalist Bram Brugger, who investigated the Dutch fishing giants for years. Not only is the company intensively fishing in African waters; in fact, also most of the fish it catches worldwide is sold in Africa. Atlantic Shrimpers is a prime example.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Atlantic Shrimpers was born in the 1980s when three fishing companies decided to put their resources together. Over the years, it grew its fleet to currently over 70 vessels. When exactly Cornelis Vrolijk acquired the company is unclear. Another of Cornelis Vrolijk's subsidiaries, Primstar B.V., acts as the sole marketer of the shrimp and fish caught by Atlantic Shrimpers.

                        <p1>
                            Rasheed Kosoko is another captain for Atlantic Shrimpers. He has worked for the company for 14 years, he tells us. When we reach him in Nigeria, he is on rest leave after a long time at sea. Usually, he says, the crews spend periods of up to 80 days on board, working day and night in shifts. Then they get to rest -- between 30 and 40 days spread throughout the year.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Rasheed enjoys working for Atlantic Shrimpers. But he is also aware of the way the company handled Captain Kazi's case. He disputes the official version of Kazi having acted against instructions and the company being unaware.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            According to Rasheed, what Kazi did is common practice. Atlantic Shrimpers sets a target of how much fish the crew should catch. If that target is not reached, the captain risks disciplinary action. If a captain repeatedly does not reach the targets, they can get fired. Rasheed says, "For us, to reach the [company's] target, we sometimes have to take a risk and go to another country. They [the captains] do that on their own -- and not everybody, but some of them." It is quite a dilemma, he says: "You can get fired for going out of the territory. Or you get fired for not meeting the targets."
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            This is what Captain Kazi faced, says Rasheed. His vessel, the Star Shrimper XXV, was registered in Ivory Coast. But he was unable to meet the targets in Ivory Coast waters. "So, he has to sneak into Liberia. And he was caught."
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Atlantic Shrimpers is very much aware of this practice, says Rasheed. He emphasizes that Kazi's case is not an isolated incident -- what is isolated is the fact that he got caught. "We are not independent. They control us. They have monitors on each vessel to know our movements."
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            This stands in stark contrast to the statements made by Cornelis Vrolijk about this issue. But it matches other indications we found. Quite often, for example, Star Shrimper vessels turn off their AIS -- a required transponder for position, vessel ID, and other data -- while fishing in areas close to territorial borders.

                            Cornelis Vrolijk is not only active in Nigeria, however. Other important African fishing grounds are Mauretania, Western Sahara, and Namibia. In Namibia, issues with Cornelis Vrolijk became public once again.

                        <h1>
                            Vrolijk's foothold in Namibia
                        </h1>
                        <p1>
                            A Friday in mid-July of 2020 in Swakopmund, Namibia. The Namibian fishery observer Rauna Mhata came almost alone to the court hearing in the city's Magistrates Court; only a family member joined. On the other side of the room, however, a large group of people has assembled. 
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            The group consists of three Dutch men -- captain, chief officer, and fishing master of the Cornelis Vrolijk Fzn, a Namibian-flagged freezer trawler -- as well as several lawyers and supporters. They are all there that Friday because Rauna Mhata came forward with grave accusations against the crew members.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Not only did Mhata claim to have observed the illegal dumping of dead fish when she was onboard the Cornelis Vrolijk Fzn on behalf of the Namibian authorities, she also accused the crew of assault and intimidation. That second charge, assault and intimidation, was suddenly withdrawn later. The charge of illegally dumping large quantities of dead fish in the ocean remains. In the end, the case is thrown out. It is Mhata's word against that of the crew. 
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Journalist Ester Mbathera, who observed the trial, is certain that Rauna Mhata told the truth. The overarching issue, according to her, is that Fishery Observers are frequently being intimidated. The initial accusation of assault and intimidation speaks to that. So did the atmosphere in court, she says: "You could sense the intimidation."
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Ester tried to speak to Rauna Mhata after the court case. The observer did not want to. Ester says that is normal. "They are not very keen on speaking. We really don't know what else happens on the water," Ester says. We experienced the same -- our own attempts at contacting Rauna Mhata were unsuccessful.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            The vessel that was involved in this scandal -- the Cornelis Vrolijk Fzn -- belonged to Cornelis Vrolijk at the time, unsurprisingly. The company's foothold in Namibia is less continuous and intensive as in, for example, Mauretania -- where Vrolijk built <a href="https://www.cornelisvrolijk.eu/media/gxpaz2zl/cv-mvo-2019_def_eng_lr.pdf">whole factories.</a> In Namibia, Cornelis Vrolijk had to work with local partners to secure influence and quotas. These partners are Alex and George Kirov, often just referred to as the Kirov Brothers.

                        <h1>
                            The Kirovs
                        </h1>
                        <p1>
                            Originally from Bulgaria, the Kirov Brothers have lived in Namibia for over thirty years. They became successful in the fishing sector and now control a vast array of companies. Journalist Ester Mbathera, who also investigated the brothers in the past, says they almost solely run the market of selling Namibian horse mackerel in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- where around 90 percent of the caught mackerel goes.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            For Cornelis Vrolijk, the brothers are ideal partners. Not only can they provide existing infrastructure, they are also extremely well-connected politically. Alex Kirov, the younger of the two brothers, sits on the Namibian Marine Resource Advisory Council. The council holds considerable power in advising the government on how and to whom to distribute fishing quotas. Past generous allocations of quotas to companies the Kirovs are involved in highlight the problem with Alex Kirov's seat on this board, Ester Mbathera says. 
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            According to Ester, locals see the Kirovs' presence as problematic. "Everybody in town, when you speak to them about the Kirov brothers, they will tell you to be very careful. Because the Bulgarians can kill you. They think the Bulgarians are Mafia, they are dangerous people."
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            We found no independent evidence that points towards the Kirovs being dangerous. But evidence does highlight their dubious activities. Besides quota allocation schemes, their name appears in the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/fishrot/database/raw_data/lg_pdf_view/b9a50a1c46153c19e042dccf7be4af37.pdf">leaked files</a> that led to the Fishrot scandal, and their companies provided crew for the Cornelis Vrolijk Fzn when the vessel was caught dumping fish and the crew got accused of assaulting the fishery officer, Rauna Mhata. George Kirov, says Ester Mbathera, actually left the country for the Canary Islands because he got into trouble with Namibian authorities. Alex Kirov remained in Namibia.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Cornelis Vrolijk and the Kirov brothers have been cooperating for a while. In 2015, <a href="https://www.schuttevaer.nl/nieuws/visserij/2015/06/04/sch-27-scombrus-krijgt-russische-eigenaar/">Vrolijk sold</a> their trawler 'Scombrus' to them. While the article reporting on the sale only spoke of new "Russian owners," we found that the Scombrus was in fact sold to the Kirov brothers. The company now owning the vessel under its new name 'Mediva Star' -- Scombrus Fishing Pty -- has Alex Kirov as director.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Years later, in 2021, the Cornelis Vrolijk Fzn vessel was also sold to the Kirovs. Earlier, an <a href="https://www.groene.nl/artikel/vissen-in-troebel-water">article</a> by journalist Bram Logger uncovered that the vessel was illegally obtaining cheaper quotas meant for Namibian-owned vessels by using a shell company in the country. Whether the article prompted the sale is unclear. Now in the hands of the Kirov brothers, however, the vessel allowed a diversification of the spectrum of companies owned by the brothers that receive quotas. A clever move after several scandals surrounding quota allocations rocked Namibia. 
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            We reached out to the Cornelis Vrolijk manager who handled the sale and asked him whether there continues to be any affiliation between Cornelis Vrolijk and the vessel -- or with the Kirov brothers in general. We received no response. The manager's position as director of North Atlantic Fishing Holdings -- Vrolijk's UK arm that held the Namibian shell company that owned the Cornelis Vrolijk Fzn -- was terminated the same month the sale occurred. He held the position for six years.

                            Secrecy is part of the business
                        </h1>
                        <p1>
                            This secrecy is common. None of the representatives of Cornelis Vrolijk or its subsidiaries we reached out to were willing to talk to us. According to Pavel Klinckhamer, a Greenpeace activist with close knowledge of the Dutch fishing giants, this is not surprising. It rather reflects the nature of the business. What happens at sea, stays at sea. "And that gives opportunity to do bad stuff," Pavel says. Consequently, much of what is happening we will simply never hear of.
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            In this field, much depends on individuals involved in the operations to come forward. In the fishrot scandal, it was the Icelandic manager Johannes Stefansson who took the step. In this investigation, it was Atlantic Shrimper captain Rasheed Kosoko who made clear that Captain Kazi's illegal fishing in Liberian waters was not an isolated incident -- and that the company was aware of that, that it condones it. 
                        </p1>
                        <p1>
                            Rasheed, too, is thinking of quitting. He wants to start his own company. With his 14 years of experience, he believes he is ready to take the helm himself: "It's everybody's dream and everybody's prayer. To have his own company. I have been working under a company for years, and if I have the opportunity to start my own company, I will take it." Atlantic Shrimpers, he says, will support that. "We are friends."
